"""
This software is meant to manage the Beam Synchronous Acquisition software
(BSAS). Meant to run continuously as a daemon process, it starts a program to
acquire and coalesce data and another to record the resulting data.  The
acquisition software learns of the data to acquire from an input file which
names a set of NTTable PVs. It will gather data from those PVs and merge them
together into a larger table.  This larger, merged NTTable is then monitored by
a Writer process which records it in an hierarchical file format for offline
analysis.  Both programs can run on the same processor, but can also run on
separate computers.

At least one of the merger or writer applications shall be managed by this
program.  If the merger program is started, the input file containing the
NTTable PVs is constantly monitored for changes and the merger app restarted
as required.  If the writer program is started by itself, the input file is
not monitored for changes.

This software is intended to run on Linux

The Merge software ignores PVs from the input list which are unresponsive and
will exit when given a termination signal.  The Writer software will wait for
the merged NTTable PV to become available then exit when that PV disconnects,
typically when the Merge application exits.

After starting the Merger application, this program is responsible for
monitoring the input file containing the NTTable PVs to acquire.  When it finds
a change, it stops the Merger software and restarts it, as well as the Writer
application if it was requested.

Recording its actions is an important part of this software, but only 2 weeks
of log files are maintained along with the current logfile.
